# PortfolioWebsite
This personal portfolio website is designed to be responsive and visually appealing while showcasing various projects and experiences. Key features include a dynamic header with a navigation bar linking to different sections of the site, an About Me section detailing educational background and professional experience, and a Portfolio section displaying projects with interactive overlays. The use of CSS Grid and Flexbox ensures that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining a consistent appearance across devices. Additionally, custom CSS styles enhance the user experience with smooth transitions, hover effects, and a cohesive color scheme, while JavaScript handles the tabbed navigation for seamless content switching. The website also uses Font Awesome icons and links to external resources to further increase the website's functionality and accessibility.
